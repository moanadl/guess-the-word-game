# Intro

This is a guessing game in which the user has to guess the secret word drawn by the site. The user can choose the level of difficulty (easy: 10 guesses, medium: 5 guesses, or hard: 3 guesses) and the theme of the sorted word (fruits, animals, artists/bands or random).

The letter can be input by using the keyboard or the microfone through the Speech Recognition API.

This project has helped me to understand better the use of APIs. It has also been an opportunity to practice a lot of CSS and JS. There are several aspects that can be enhanced in the project. And those enhancements will happen together with the evolution of my experience.

# Next steps

- Make the site responsive;
- Develop some kind of score system for the game;
- Improve the visual of the site;
